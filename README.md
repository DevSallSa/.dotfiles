# DevSallSa's dotfiles

This is my personal dotfiles made with long night, tears and blood (yes) and
some holiday sacrificed.

> :warning: Make sure you have `GNU Stow` installed.

## The GOAL

Well,

- I want to avoid the hassle of setting up a new UNIX\* dev environment
- Make this repo as a reference for those who want to save their configs
  or want to automate it.
  > If you want to use my dotfiles, there is a possibility that some configs may
  > be useless for you.

> Don't hesitate to delete them before running the install script.

## Things todo

- [x] Make install script
- [x] Make uninstall script
- [x] Make dotfiles public
- [ ] Make README.md more clear, more precise, more intuitive
